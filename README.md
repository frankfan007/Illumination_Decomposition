# Illumination_Decomposition
Code for TIP 2017 paper --- Illumination Decomposition for Photograph with Multiple Light Sources.

<p>This code implements the core part of illumination decomposition in our paper via Visual Studio. Please add it to your project. The only dependency is OpenCV. We adopted an old OpenCV (1.X) naming style. You can rewrite it to adapt more recent ones.</p>
